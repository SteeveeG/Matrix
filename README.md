# Matrix NuGet Library

The Matrix library is a small yet powerful tool that allows you to create a letter matrix in the console, reminiscent of those seen in iconic films. This library generates a sequence of "random words" that gradually transform into a predefined target word or phrase.

## Features

- **Classic Matrix**: Starts by displaying all words immediately and concludes with the final word or phrase. You can customize whether the matrix includes special characters, numbers, and letters. The number of words between each new correct letter can also be configured.

- **Continuous Matrix**: Continuously presents one letter at a time until the entire word or phrase is written. This version allows you to define an alternative display action instead of using `Console.WriteLine`.

## Customization Options

- **Special Characters, Numbers, and Letters**: Decide which characters are included in the matrix.
- **Spacing and Pauses**: Set how many "words" are shown between correct letters and whether pauses are introduced to control the effect.

## Example Use

The Matrix library is ideal for creative console applications that require visual effects or for developers interested in experimenting with unique text presentations.
